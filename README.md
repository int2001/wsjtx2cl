#### Features
* When clicking on a spot in WaveLog-Bandmap your TRX with QSY to the Spot.
* If you log a (non WSJT-X) QSO first go to "Stations Tab" and chose "WSJTX 2 WL" as Radio. After that Band/Mode/QRG will be automatically taken from your Rig into the QSO-Fields
* When clicking the loupe at Live-QSO/Post-QSO Wavelog will automaticly lookup the Spot behind the QRG (if there's a spot)

Enjoy
